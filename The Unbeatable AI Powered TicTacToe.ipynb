    "Tic Tac Toe, a game that has stood the test of time, is a favourite pastime for people across all age groups. Its charm lies in its simplicity - a mere 3x3 grid, yet it is a game that requires a significant amount of strategic thinking and planning. Players are constantly engaged in a mental tug-of-war, juggling between offensive and defensive moves. The game unfolds in a myriad of ways, leading to countless possible outcomes. This level of complexity, masked by apparent simplicity, makes Tic Tac Toe a fascinating and ideal platform for testing and refining Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of AI has made significant strides in recent years, and games like Tic Tac Toe provide a perfect proving ground for these advancements. The game offers a controlled yet challenging environment where AI algorithms can be trained, tested, and improved. It provides an opportunity for AI to learn the nuances of strategic decision-making, understand the balance between offense and defence, and adapt to different game scenarios.\n",

    "## About Minimax Algorithm:\n",
    "***\n",
    "The Minimax algorithm is a type of backtracking algorithm used in decision making and game theory. It’s designed to determine the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. This makes it particularly useful in two-player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Minimax algorithm, the two players are referred to as the maximizer and the minimizer. The maximizer aims to achieve the highest score possible, while the minimizer aims to achieve the lowest score possible. Each state of the game board has a value associated with it, which is calculated based on certain heuristics that are unique to each type of game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm explores all possible moves, then backtracks and makes a decision. It performs a depth-first search of the game tree, proceeding all the way down to the terminal node of the tree, then backtracks as the recursion unwinds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple pseudocode representation of the Minimax algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) is\n",
    "  if depth == 0 or node is a terminal node then\n",

    "    return minEva\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Working of Min-Max Algorithm:\n",
    "*\tThe working of the minimax algorithm can be easily described using an example. Below we have taken an example of game-tree which is representing the two-player game.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Step-1:__ In the initial phase of the algorithm, a complete game-tree is constructed, and a utility function is applied to assign values to the terminal states. Consider a tree diagram where 'A' represents the initial state. The game begins with the maximizer's turn, which starts with an initial worst-case value of negative infinity. Following this, the minimizer takes their turn, starting with a worst-case initial value of positive infinity. This process ensures a comprehensive evaluation of all possible outcomes in the game-tree.\n",

Each terminal state value is then compared with this initial value. The objective is to identify node values that exceed this initial value. In essence, this step seeks the maximum value among all terminal states, which represents the optimal choice for the Maximizing Player. This procedure is a crucial part of the Maximizing Player's strategic decision-making within the game-tree.\n",

Essentially, this step determines the values of the nodes in the third layer of the game-tree. This process is a key part of the Minimizing Player's strategic decision-making within the game-tree.

In this particular game-tree, there are only four layers, which allows us to quickly reach the root node. However, it's important to note that in more complex scenarios, such as real-world games, the game-tree could have more than four layers. This complexity would necessitate additional iterations of the algorithm to reach the root node and determine the optimal strategy.

    "\n",
    "### Limitation of the minimax Algorithm:\n",
    "1. **Computational Complexity**: The algorithm has to visit each board state twice: once to find its children and a second time to evaluate the heuristic value. This can be computationally expensive, especially for games with a large branching factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Speed**: Minimax tends to be slow for games with many choices per turn, like chess. The deeper the game tree, the slower the algorithm gets.\n",

    "Certainly, let's delve deeper into the functionality of the `main()` function in the context of this game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The function begins by initializing the game objects. This includes the game itself, the game board, and the AI player. These objects are crucial for the gameplay and their initial state sets the stage for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Game Loop**: The function then enters a continuous loop, which is the heart of the game. This loop keeps the game running and updates according to the player's actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Handling**: Within the loop, the function listens for events triggered by the player. These events can be a mouse click, a key press, or even a request to quit the game. Each event has a corresponding response that affects the game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Press Events**: If a key is pressed, the function checks which key it is and performs the corresponding action. This could be changing the game mode, resetting the board, changing the AI from 'random moves' and 'AI mode', or letting the AI start the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mouse Click Events**: If a mouse button is clicked, the function calculates which square of the game board was clicked. If the game is still running and the clicked square is empty, the function makes a move at that square.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **AI Moves**: If the game mode is set to 'AI vs Player' and it's the AI's turn, the function lets the AI evaluate the board and make a move. The screen is updated after the AI makes its move.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Game Over Check**: After each move, the function checks if the game is over. If it is, the game stops running.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Screen Update**: Finally, the function updates the screen to reflect the new game state. This update happens after every event and after every AI move.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function serves as a quintessential illustration of the operational dynamics within a game's primary loop. It's a testament to the intricate orchestration of user interactions and game state management in real-time gaming environments. It continuously checks for user input, updates the game state, and redraws the screen. It's a dynamic process that keeps the game engaging and responsive to the player's actions. The use of different functions for different tasks keeps the code modular, organized, and easy to understand. This is a fundamental aspect of professional game development. The `main()` function encapsulates all these elements, making it the backbone of the game. It's a testament to the power of well-structured code in creating an engaging and seamless gaming experience."
